two-pass template processing

ttree --start_tag="{%" --end_tag="%}" --define lang=de

copies the site from `src/` to `pass1/de`. This means that images etc. are copied as well, but that's acceptable.

Do this for the languages `de`, `en` and `jp`.

Files in `lib/` are included in the first pass, so files in `src` don't have directives like `INCLUDE` or `WRAPPER` anymore.

{% INCLUDE sketch %}

Every page has the language flags in the header. They will take you to the same page in a different language.
