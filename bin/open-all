Open a list of sketches (works and techniques) in the browser. It takes an
optional list of strings that mention a sketch directories on STDIN or on ARGV. The exact string doesn't matter as long as it includes a sketch directory (<W20xx.xx.xx>).

This means you can use C<ack> to filter for sketches that you want to open:

    ack -w alpha **/sketch.js | ./bin/open-all

or

    ./bin/open-all src/W2022.10.*

The corresponding sketches are then opened in the browser.

If no paths are given on STDIN, it looks for all sketch directoies and opens
them all.

Useful if you have made a large-scale change and want to see whether everything
still works.
