The "eff_short_wordlist_2_0" contains 1296 words whose first three letters are
unique. This program reads the word list and extracts the first three letters.
It then generates a name by choosing three random words and concatenating them
with a dot.

These random names are better than numbering the sketches because if you delete
a sketch you won't get obvious gaps in the numbering.
