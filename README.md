# danubedataflow.com

Code for the website.

To build the site, install the
[Template::Toolkit](https://metacpan.org/pod/Template::Toolkit) from CPAN.

Also install the dependencies:

    npm install

Then run:

    make site

This installs the site in `~/www/danubedataflow`.

All internal links are relative, so you can just use your browser's
`file://` protocol to open the `index.html` page.
