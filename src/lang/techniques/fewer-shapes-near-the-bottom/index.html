[% WRAPPER sketch title=t.sl('Fewer shapes near the bottom', 'Nach unten hin weniger Objekte') %]

<p>There is a percentage that goes from 0 at the top to 1 at the bottom. For a
square to be drawn, a random number has to be bigger than that percentage
raised to the given power. Therefore, the higher the exponent, the smaller the
threshold becomes, and the more likely it is that a square will be drawn.</p>
