            <p>Joan Mitchell:</p>
            <blockquote>
                You ask me why did I put white lines. You also ask me why did I put red
                lines and stuff. You also ask me why I paint. I don't know. The moment
                you put the bla bla bla on it, it destroys the whole thing.

            <p>Vera Molnár:</p>
            <blockquote>
                I have no regrets. My life is squares, triangles, lines.
            </blockquote>

            <p>Pierre Soulages:</p>
            <blockquote>
                It is what I do that teaches me what I'm looking for.

            <p>Sol LeWitt:</p>
            <blockquote>
                In conceptual art, the idea or the concept is the most important aspect
                of the work. When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means
                that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the
                execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that
                makes the art.
            </blockquote>

            <p>Jean-Michel Jarre:</p>
            <blockquote>
                Technology, and the Internet also, make you think that everything has
                been done. You wake up with a fresh idea, and you check on the
                Internet, and by noon you think that it's a very old idea that has been
                done a million times.<br /><br />

                And it's not true. Or it's not more or less true than [it was] twenty
                years ago, one century ago.<br /><br />

                It's not because an idea has been thought by somebody else that your
                idea is not original because it's your own interpretation of the idea
                that is going to make your idea specific and original.<br /><br />

                Because an idea has no value until you engage yourself to it and you
                realize it. For instance you take any kind of [creator], like Quentin
                Tarantino or deadmau5 or Coldplay or whoever. I mean, if you think
                about it, what they are telling us is not new. You can have a song
                about love, about solitude, a movie about bad guys against good guys,
                but these are very old concepts. We are telling the same stories for
                centuries.<br /><br />

                There is nothing new in terms of human feelings, human emotions; they
                are the same generation after generation. It's just the tools we are
                using; and also if you are telling a story and if I tell the same
                story, what's going to be interesting or not is the way you are going
                to tell the story.<br /><br />

                So it's not a matter of saying that there is nothing new that I can
                achieve.

            <p>El Lissitzky:</p>
            <blockquote>
                The machine has not separated us from nature; through it we have
                discovered a new nature never before surmised.
            </blockquote>

            <p>El Lissitzky:</p>
            <blockquote>
                [Art], like science, has broken down form down to its basic elements in
                order to rebuild it according to the universal laws of nature. And they
                both came to the same formula: every form is the frozen snapshot of a
                process. This a work of art is a stopping point on the road of
                becoming, and not the fixed goal.
            </blockquote>

            <p>Frieder Nake:</p>
            <blockquote>
                Each and every individual piece of algorithmic art is no more than only
                one instance of the potentially infinitely many from the class of works
                defined by the algorithm. The tragedy is that the algorithm itself does
                not often show visual qualities. Its qualities are the potential to
                generate visual works. But each of its visual products is a shadow only
                of the algorithm. It is one of its traces, a left-over, a consolation
                for those who need to see rather than think. If you want to find the
                masterpiece, you must compare algorithms.
