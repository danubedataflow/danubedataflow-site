    <p>Joan Mitchell:</p>

    <blockquote>
        You ask me why did I put white lines. You also ask me why did I put red
        lines and stuff. You also ask me why I paint. I don't know. The moment
        you put the bla bla bla on it, it destroys the whole thing.

    <p>Vera Moln√°r:</p>

    <blockquote>
        I have no regrets. My life is squares, triangles, lines.

    <p>Pierre Soulages:</p>

    <blockquote>
        It is what I do that teaches me what I'm looking for.

    <p>Sol LeWitt:</p>

    <blockquote>
        In conceptual art, the idea or the concept is the most important aspect
        of the work. When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means
        that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the
        execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that
        makes the art.

    <p>Jean-Michel Jarre:</p>

    <blockquote>
        Technology, and the Internet also, make you think that everything has
        been done. You wake up with a fresh idea, and you check on the
        Internet, and by noon you think that it's a very old idea that has been
        done a million times.<br /><br />

        And it's not true. Or it's not more or less true than [it was] twenty
        years ago, one century ago.<br /><br />

        It's not because an idea has been thought by somebody else that your
        idea is not original because it's your own interpretation of the idea
        that is going to make your idea specific and original.<br /><br />

        Because an idea has no value until you engage yourself to it and you
        realize it. For instance you take any kind of [creator], like Quentin
        Tarantino or deadmau5 or Coldplay or whoever. I mean, if you think
        about it, what they are telling us is not new. You can have a song
        about love, about solitude, a movie about bad guys against good guys,
        but these are very old concepts. We are telling the same stories for
        centuries.<br /><br />

        There is nothing new in terms of human feelings, human emotions; they
        are the same generation after generation. It's just the tools we are
        using; and also if you are telling a story and if I tell the same
        story, what's going to be interesting or not is the way you are going
        to tell the story.<br /><br />

        So it's not a matter of saying that there is nothing new that I can
        achieve.
