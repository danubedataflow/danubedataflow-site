    "W2023.10.05-description": "Take a probability value that goes from 0 at the top to 1 at the bottom. In order for a square to be drawn in a row, a random number must be larger than the probability value raised to the power of a given value. So the higher the exponent, the lower the threshold becomes, and the more likely it is that a square will be drawn."
