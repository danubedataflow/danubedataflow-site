            <p>2023-09-18</p>

            <p>Some artists seem to be more interested in success than in art itself.
                The art world is dominated by connections and money, and these are people
                who want to advance their careers and curry favor with art critics,
                galleries, and museums.</p>

            <p>Because my day job in software development has made me financially
                independent, I have the luxury of working free from monetary
                constraints.</p>

            <p>I prefer to have my own livelihood and income and the freedom to be
                creative without having to bow to commercial interests.</p>

            <p>A digital artist doesn't need to rent an extremely expensive art studio
                in New York. The costs are very low. I only need a laptop, an internet
                connection, a website, and so on. And as long as my basic needs are met, I
                can concentrate on the creative work.</p>
