            <p>2023-09-17</p>

            <p>The following lines are inspired by an interview given by Jean-Michel
                Jarre.</p>

            <p>When classical instruments like the piano or violin appeared, they
                changed the nature of music. The same thing happened and continues to
                happen today with electronic and purely digital instruments. And the same
                thing can be seen in different art forms.</p>

            <p>Technology determines style.</p>

            <p>In a 2017 interview, Jean-Michel Jarre said that without Native
                Instruments' "Massive" plugin, the dubstep genre probably wouldn't exist.
                I've also heard elsewhere that some plugins have had a big impact on
                electronic music genres.</p>

            <p>In generative design you can also see this with WebGL, Processing, p5.js
                and other tools. But we shouldn't be dependent on the software we use for
                generative design.</p>

            <p>We rely on these technologies, but you shouldn't expect too much from
                them. What differentiates the artists who use these technologies is the way
                they use them.</p>

            <p>I see my parameterized work in a similar way. Certain groups of
                parameters are like virtual instruments that give the work a certain "sound
                quality".</p>

            <p>This is an example of how one art form—electronic music—can influence
                another art form—creative design.</p>
