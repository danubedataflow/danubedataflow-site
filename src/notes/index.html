            <h2>Financial independence</h2>

            <p>2023.09.18</p>

            <p>Some artists seem to be more interested in success than in art itself.
                The art world is dominated by connections and money, and these are people
                who want to advance their careers and curry favor with art critics,
                galleries, and museums.</p>

            <p>Because my day job in software development has made me financially
                independent, I have the luxury of working free from monetary
                constraints.</p>

            <p>I prefer to have my own livelihood and income and the freedom to be
                creative without having to bow to commercial interests.</p>

            <p>A digital artist doesn't need to rent an extremely expensive art studio
                in New York. The costs are very low. I only need a laptop, an internet
                connection, a website, and so on. And as long as my basic needs are met, I
                can concentrate on the creative work.</p>

            <h2>Technology determines style</h2>

            <p>2023.09.17</p>

            <p>The following lines are inspired by an interview given by Jean-Michel
                Jarre.</p>

            <p>When classical instruments like the piano or violin appeared, they
                changed the nature of music. The same thing happened and continues to
                happen today with electronic and purely digital instruments. And the same
                thing can be seen in different art forms.</p>

            <p>Technology determines style.</p>

            <p>In a 2017 interview, Jean-Michel Jarre said that without Native
                Instruments' "Massive" plugin, the dubstep genre probably wouldn't exist.
                I've also heard elsewhere that some plugins have had a big impact on
                electronic music genres.</p>

            <p>In generative design you can also see this with WebGL, Processing, p5.js
                and other tools. But we shouldn't be dependent on the software we use for
                generative design.</p>

            <p>We rely on these technologies, but you shouldn't expect too much from
                them. What differentiates the artists who use these technologies is the way
                they use them.</p>

            <p>I see my parameterized work in a similar way. Certain groups of
                parameters are like virtual instruments that give the work a certain "sound
                quality".</p>

            <p>This is an example of how one art form—electronic music—can influence
                another art form—creative design.</p>

            <h2>Self-imposed restrictions</h2>

            <p>2023.09.16</p>

            <ul>

                <li>I have imposed the following restrictions on myself:</li>

                <li>The canvas must be square.</li>

                <li>For works that use a grid, the tiles must be square as
                well. That is, the same number of tiles horizontally and
                vertically.</li>

                <li>The shapes should be minimal—lines, rectangles, triangles.</li>

                <li>Two-dimensional flat drawings if possible.</li>

                <li>Not figurative, just abstract.</li>

                <li>Short algorithms are better because they are more likely to show the
                    complex geometric patterns that arise from simple mathematical and
                    algorithmic relationships.</li>

                <li>Not iterative. If possible, avoid "first draw this part, then draw that
                    part." The whole picture should emerge from a single idea, a single
                    algorithm. (This is not always possible.)</li>

                <li>No text or emoji. Individual letters, kanji or other Unicode characters
                    that are abstracted are possible.</li>

                <li>No external resources like images or fonts. The source code must be
                    completely standalone and independent.</li>

                <li>No data visualization such as charts; no infographics.</li>

                <li>No user interaction with the mouse, trackpad or camera.</li>

                <li>No animations.</li>

                <li>No AI image generators.</li>

            </ul>
