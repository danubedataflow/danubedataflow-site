    "note-2023.09.18-text-02": "Because I have become financially independent through my day job, software development, I have the luxury of being able to work free of monetary constraints.",
    "note-2023.09.18-text-03": "I prefer to have my own livelihood and income and the freedom to be creative without having to bow to commercial interests.",
