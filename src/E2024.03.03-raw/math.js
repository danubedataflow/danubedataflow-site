/*
 * Take care to initialize your PRNGs properly. To keep things simple, the
 * generators below have no built-in seed generating procedure, but accept one
 * or more 32-bit numbers as the initial seed state of the PRNG. Similar or
 * sparse seeds (e.g. a simple seed of 1 and 2) have low entropy, and can cause
 * correlations or other randomness quality issues, sometimes resulting in the
 * output having similar properties (such as randomly generated levels being
 * similar). To avoid this, it is best practice to initialize PRNGs with a
 * well-distributed, high entropy seed and/or advancing past the first 15 or so
 * numbers.
 *
 * There are many ways to do this, but here are two methods. Firstly, hash
 * functions are very good at generating seeds from short strings. A good hash
 * function will generate very different results even when two strings are
 * similar, so you don't have to put much thought into the string. Here's an
 * example hash function.
 *
 * Calling cyrb128 will produce a 128-bit hash value from a string which can be
 * used to seed a PRNG.
