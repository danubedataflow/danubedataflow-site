        You ask me why did I put white lines. You also ask me why did I put red
        lines and stuff. You also ask me why I paint. I don't know. The moment
        you put the bla bla bla on it, it destroys the whole thing.

        I have no regrets. My life is squares, triangles, lines.

    <p>Sol LeWitt:</p>

    <blockquote>
        In conceptual art, the idea or the concept is the most important aspect
        of the work. When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means
        that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the
        execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that
        makes the art.

    <p>David Bull, ukiyo-e woodblock printer, in a <a

    by Andrés Rodriguez Cortés</a>:</p>

    <blockquote>
        When it comes to developing ability at something, a craft like this, or
        perhaps at a sport, anything really, we commonly hear people talking
        about such things as “it takes ten thousand hours” as though it were
        simply a matter of spending enough time and making enough repetitions.
        But that’s not true. […]. It’s no good spending ten thousand hours on
        practice if you’re going to simply spend the same hour ten thousand
        times.<br /><br />

        You have to be constantly probing and investigating everything you do.
        Why did it turn out this way? What was wrong? What do I have to do to
        make it better next time? Each and every one of those ten thousand
        hours or whatever the magic number might be has to be spent in such
        analysis. Mindless repetition, no matter how long, will get you
        nowhere.

    <p>Jean-Michel Jarre on creativity:</p>

    <blockquote>
        Technology, and the Internet also, make you think that everything has
        been done. You wake up with a fresh idea, and you check on the
        Internet, and by noon you think that it's a very old idea that has been
        done a million times.<br /><br />

        And it's not true. Or it's not more or less true than [it was] twenty
        years ago, one century ago.<br /><br />

        It's not because an idea has been thought by somebody else that your
        idea is not original because it's your own interpretation of the idea
        that is going to make your idea specific and original.<br /><br />

        Because an idea has no value until you engage yourself to it and you
        realize it. For instance you take any kind of [creator], like Quentin
        Tarantino or deadmau5 or Coldplay or whoever. I mean, if you think
        about it, what they are telling us is not new. You can have a song
        about love, about solitude, a movie about bad guys against good guys,
        but these are very old concepts. We are telling the same stories for
        centuries.<br /><br />

        There is nothing new in terms of human feelings, human emotions; they
        are the same generation after generation. It's just the tools we are
        using; and also if you are telling a story and if I tell the same
        story, what's going to be interesting or not is the way you are going
        to tell the story.<br /><br />

        So it's not a matter of saying that there is nothing new that I can
        achieve.
