[% WRAPPER sketch title="Margin" %]

<p>
If you create a stroked rectangle on the whole canvas, half the stroke will be clipped. Using <code>translate()</code> and <code>scale()</code> you can keep using the same coordinates - you don't have to scale things manually or calculate offsets. Everything will be scaled down, so you can see the whole stroke and it looks like there is a margin.</p>
